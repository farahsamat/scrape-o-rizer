# SCRAPE AND SUMMARIZE
The main focus on this project is to scrape data from a website and to produce a summary of the page content. The packages used for web scraping and text summarization are [beautifulsoup4](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) and [gensim](https://pypi.org/project/gensim/) respectively. This app runs on [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
