Automatic Question Answering - Towards Data Science

The approach that will be discussed in this article is based on an algorithm designed specifically for factoid question answering.
The returned answer is in the form of short texts rather than a list of relevant documents.‚Äù If you choose to answer open-domain questions, the source of information can be: your own documents, Common Crawl, Wikipedia, some ontologies like DBpedia or Google knowledge graph, also you can try Google custom search engine.
In our project Google custom search engine was chosen, because it returns the most relevant information not only from Wiki, but also from other indexed pages.
Also, Google custom search engine returns a list of URLs with a short summary, that could be used as an answer passage for the next steps.
Here is an example of an automatically found answer to the same question by using different approaches.
This approach can be applied for real business cases as a part of Question answering/user support system.
